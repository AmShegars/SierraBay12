changes:
  - bugfix: Clicking atoms while holding any combination of alt, shift, or control,
      or middle-clicking them should no longer perform multiple actions (I.e., rotating
      an object and toggling the turf tab).
  - tweak: Underlying code for handling modified clicks (ALT, SHIFT or CTRL + Click
      or Middle click) has been refactored. There should be no user facing changes
      other than those listed in the changelog.

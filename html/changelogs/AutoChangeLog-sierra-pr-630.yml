changes:
  - rscadd: Adds the hand drill, a portable hand drill that can swap between a bolt
      and screw head. Does (most) things twice as fast! Sprites done by Azlan.
  - rscadd: Adds the hydraulic prying tool, a tool that can swap between prying and
      cutting heads. Does (most) things twice as fast! Sprites also done by Azlan.
  - tweak: Redoes tool logic to allow for tools that perform actions faster or slower
      than the baseline.
  - maptweak: Changes the toolbelt in the Chief Engineer's locker to include a hand
      drill and hydraulic prying tool.

changes:
  - rscadd: Adds a marksman rifle. It's branded as an ICCGN service rifle.
  - tweak: The Z8/heavy bullpup now has a more obvious grenade launcher on it.
  - tweak: The Z9/light bullpup no longer has a grenade launcher.
  - tweak: The light 7mmR ammunition now uses the weaker projectile than the heavy
      7mmR ammunition. Previously, it was made the other way around.
  - bugfix: The carbine rifle's sprite is now properly aligned form all sides and
      both hands. Previously it was sort of just floating there.
  - rscadd: Adds GUN_BULK_LIGHT_RIFLE and GUN_BULK_HEAVY_RIFLE to replace some +1
      and -1 values in automatic.dm and sniper.dm

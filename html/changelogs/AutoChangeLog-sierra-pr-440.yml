changes:
  - bugfix: Gutters can no longer be assembled inside of mobs, storage containers,
      or anywhere else that isn't a turf.
  - bugfix: Classic chairs, fancy chairs, and pews now use the correct material when
      crafted.
  - bugfix: Using cables on crates now properly creates a wire-rigged crate, instead
      of silently failing.
  - bugfix: Circuit printers and autolathes that run out of resources while printing
      will now properly display their 'Out of X' message if the resource amount is
      `0` or was never added.
  - tweak: Board game UI is now opened by ALT+CLICKing the board. The board can now
      be picked up and handled like any other item with a normal left click, and shift+click
      examines the board.

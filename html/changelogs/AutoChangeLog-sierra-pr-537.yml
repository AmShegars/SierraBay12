changes:
  - bugfix: Magnetic weapons no longer delete existing ammunition if attempting to
      load a stack while loaded with a non-stack projectile.
  - bugfix: Magnetic weapons no longer allow you to increase the size of a loaded
      stack by loading it with an entirely different type of stack.
  - rscadd: Various item interactions with various guns now display helpful feedback
      messages on failure.
  - rscadd: Various item interactions with various guns now display visible messages
      to those around you.
  - rscadd: Loading weapons that hold more than 1 projectile at a time will now tell
      you how many projectiles are loaded out of the maximum amount. This does not
      occur for magazine fed weapons.
  - rscadd: You can now scan IDs on secure weapons without needing to remove said
      IDs from your wallet, PDA, etc, instead scanning the container itself directly
      on the gun.

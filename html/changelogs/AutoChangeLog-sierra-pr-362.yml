changes:
  - rscadd: Ported the emissives system from /tg/ (with significant influence from
      SierraBay).
  - tweak: Consoles now use the emissives system for screens and keyboards.
  - bugfix: Consoles now update their `icon_keyboard` variable, fixing off and broken
      states.
  - bugfix: The "Force Authorization" program now defines a keyboard, rather than
      defaulting to the "off" keyboard.
